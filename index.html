                Considering that there are 8,000,000,000 (8 billion) people currently residing this earth, 
                roughly around 0.27% of the population share the same birthday as me. However, what if I considered the exact second?<br><br>

                The number of babies born per each second can be estimated to be about <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/world/#people-and-society" id="birthRate" target="_blank">4.3 births/second</a>. 
                That means the second I was born, another 3-4 babies were born. But what are the chances that I, 
                along with my 3-4 true birth-mates, were born in the same tenths of a second? hundredths of a second?
                It’ll be damn near 0.<br><br>

                The moment where the world became a tangible plane for you, no matter how miniscule, was reserved for you and you only.

                Although it’s only the end of August as of this writing, I can safely say that this year (2023) was a crazy year for me. 
                I graduated high school, marking an official end of my legally-required education. I’ve become a full-fledged adult 
                in South Korea, and engaged in new activities. I’ve traveled to over four countries, staying for months at a time. 
                I’ve taken up many hobbies I’ve newly acquired or simple didn’t have time for before. If not evident, web development 
                was one of them.<br><br>

                Yet, amidst the exhilarating highs, there were also moments of lowest of the low. Challenges cropped up in facet of 
                my life I’ve never even considered, shaking my confidence to its core. Despite my resilience, there were days when 
                I found myself succumbing to escapism. My desire to evade reality led to hours spent in unproductive YouTube shorts marathons, 
                or unfocused video game sessions. I knew I had to be doing something, but I turned away from real, productive work many a time; 
                ultimately, I adapted destructive habits.<br><br>

                As I gaze at the stopwatch above me, it's as if time itself prompts me to just pause for a moment and ponder. 
                It's a symbol of the relentless march of time, ticking away without a second thought for our individual journeys. 
                These moments of reflection are fleeting, lasting no more than a couple of seconds, yet they hold a lifetime's 
                worth of thoughts and emotions. I contemplate not just this year but my entire life—the things I've done, 
                the ones I didn't, the moments of pride, and the regrets. These feelings and experiences have left their marks, 
                but so subtle that I struggle to decipher them.<br><br>

                How will I spend the time yet to unfold? When I look back five, ten years from now, what emotions will color those reflections? 
                Will they be dominated by a sense of accomplishment or regrets of opportunities not seized?<br><br>

                In the end, I have control over quality of experiences that define our lives. The stopwatch above me serves as a constant 
                reminder—a reminder that every second is a chance to embrace life, to learn, to grow, and to make sense of the beautiful 
                chaos that is our existence.
